# MoviesTrackerAndroid
<h2>Android App</h2>
<p>
You can add a movie that you've seen and so track all the movies you see.<br></br>
In the list you add the name of the movie and it will be displayed with the afferent picture (taken from the cloud) and also the date when you saw the movie.
<br></br>
After you added the movie you can edit its title or remove it from the list. If the title is edited wrong the picture will be modified (the url takes the movie's title in order to find the movie's img).
<br></br>
On user's profile you can see the user's profile picture, the username and the total of seen movies of that user.
<br></br>
You register giving a name, email and password and you login based on the email and password.
